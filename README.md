# My Learning Journey with DSA - Mastering SQL

I am excited to share my journey with Digital SkillUp Africa (DSA), the incubator hub. This repository is a documentation of my progress in SQL, understanding and demonstrating real-world tasks, problem-solving, and data-driven decision-making.

### What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structure Query Language. It is used to store, retrieve and manage data in relational databases. 

### Basic SQL Commands


SQL commands are instructions. It is used to communicate with the database. It is also used to perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data.

### *Types of SQL Commands*

-*DDL (Data Definition Language)*: Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate - define your structure!


-*DML (Data Manipulation Language)*: Insert, Merge, Update or Delete your data!

-*DCL (Data Control Language)*:  Grant, revoke -  Secure your data with permission!


-*TCL (Transaction Control Language)*: Commit, Rollback - control your database transaction!
